# Python 3.11 SqlAlchemy FastAPI

## Intro

This repo is holding an example of a djnago application. This source code is used to create templates for the source code generator used by  https://github.com/derivative-programming/ModelWinApp and https://secure.derivative-programming.com

Addition of features to this repo adds features to source code generated by the deriviative-programming domains services.
  
##todo
handle if column is encrypted. 
stream out if objwf output param is set to stream out 
cache lookups. individual ones? in memory? by code? by id? lookups only? not during testing
issue on organization tests on  build org_custome. same for org_api_key.  they are intersection tables.

## Tech Used 
SqlAlchemy
pydantic
FastApi

## notes
defaults to local SqlLite db
tests use sqllite im-memory db
models: usual orm stuff
reports: for queries across models. Pagenated, searchable,
managers: controllers to access models
business: wraps model instances to give enhanced features
flows: holds business logic. format [owner model name].[business flow name]
apis: endpoints to access reports and flows

register db server with hostname as name of db instance in docker-compose (db), since its on the same network
