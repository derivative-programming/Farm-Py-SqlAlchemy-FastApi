"""
This module contains the manager classes for various models.

The manager classes provide an interface for interacting with
the database tables corresponding to the models.
They encapsulate the logic for querying, creating,
updating, and deleting records in the database.

The following manager classes are defined in this module:
- CustomerManager: Manages customer records.
- CustomerRoleManager: Manages customer role records.
- DateGreaterThanFilterManager: Manages date greater than filter records.
- ErrorLogManager: Manages error log records.
- FlavorManager: Manages flavor records.
- LandManager: Manages land records.
- OrganizationManager: Manages organization records.
- OrgApiKeyManager: Manages organization API key records.
- OrgCustomerManager: Manages organization customer records.
- PacManager: Manages PAC records.
- PlantManager: Manages plant records.
- RoleManager: Manages role records.
- TacManager: Manages TAC records.
- TriStateFilterManager: Manages tri-state filter records.
